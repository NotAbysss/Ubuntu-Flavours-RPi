To know if the package you selected works with your system,check if the one you downloaded is 32-bit or 64-bit.
If it is 64-Bit, ONLY USE IT ON THE PI 400, PI 4, AND THE PI 3. If it is 32-bit, you can use it on the Pi 2, Pi 3, Pi4, and Pi 400.

I am not responsible for any damage done to your system if you download and image the wrong package.
